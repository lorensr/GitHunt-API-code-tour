title: Composing a schema
code: https://github.com/apollostack/GitHunt-API/blob/8549f50246b29e7f999a96ec15406c0a82713321/api/sql/schema.js#L3-L25

In this app, we've chosen to organize the schema by where the data comes from. This part represents the three things we have in SQL: `Comment`, `Vote`, and `Entry`.

You can see that we export this section of the schema, and import it in the main schema which we saw before.
